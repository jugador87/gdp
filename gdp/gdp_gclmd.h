**  GDP_GCLMD.H --- headers for GCL metadata
**
**		THESE DEFINITIONS ARE PRIVATE!
**
**		Although the md_len field is (at least) 32 bits, only the
**		bottom 24 bits are used for the length.  The top eight bits
**		are reserved for future use (probably for tagging or typing).
**		Those bits must be zero on send and ignored on receive.
**
**		This data structure contains the data in two representations.
**		One is the on-wire format in network byte order.  The other
**		is an internal array of name/len/value triplets.  The value
**		part of the triplet is actually a pointer into the on-wire
**		format.
