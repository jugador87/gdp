.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
reads from the GDP log
.Ar log-name
and displays the output to the standard output.
.Sh OPTIONS
.Bl -tag
.It Op Fl c
Use asynchronous callbacks when doing multi-record reads
(multireads or subscriptions).
Normally the data records are processed using synchronous events.
.It Op Fl D Ar debug-spec
Turn on debugging flags using the libep-style format.
Useful only with the code in hand.
.It Op Fl f Ar first-recno
Start reading from
.Ar first-recno .
The default is to read starting from the first record,
except when using subscriptions, when the default is to read
starting from the first new data added to the log.
Negative numbers can be specified to indicate offsets from the tail of the log;
for example
.Fl f
\-2
prints starting from the next-to-last record in the log.
.It Fl G Ar router-ip
Contact the given IP address (which may be a DNS name)
to get a connection to the GDP routing layer.
This will be replaced by automatic discovery
(for example, using Zeroconf)
soon.
The address may have an optional port number after a colon.
If this is not specified,
the names listed in the
.Va swarm.gdp.routers
runtime administrative parameter
are searched.
.It Fl L Ar log-file
If set, write a very simplistic performance log to the given
.Ar log-file .
This can be used together with the companion flag on
.Xr gdp-writer 1
to produce crude round-trip performance numbers.
.It Fl m
Use multiread to collect results.
Multiread issues a single command that produces multiple results.
The default is to many read commands, each of which returns a single value.
.It Fl M
Show the log metadata before showing results.
.It Fl n Ar n-recs
Only show
.Ar n-recs
worth of data and then terminate.
The default is to show all existing data
except when using subscriptions,
where the default is to run until the process is manually killed.
.It Fl q
Don't print metadata, such as the record number and timestamp.
Together with
.Fl t
this will print nothing but the raw data in the log.
.It Fl s
Use subscriptions to show the data.
This also changes the default first record to show to be the next record added,
i.e., only show newly added records
(settable using
.Fl f )
and changes the number of records to read to be infinite
(settable using
.Fl n ).
If the first record specified already exists (e.g., using
.Fl f
1
to print starting from the first record)
the subscriptions starts as though it were a multiread
and then converts to a subscription.
For example,
.Nm
.Fl s
.Fl f
\-2
.Fl n
5
prints the last two records in a log
and then the next three that arrive.
.It Fl t
Print returned data as text.
Normally it is printed as a hexadecimal dump,
but with the character version also shown.
.It Fl v
Print verbose output.
This shows signature information as well as the data.
